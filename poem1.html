    <div class="poem1">
    at the parades, everyone 
    <br>
wants to touch my hair.
<br><br>
on the corner 
<br>
of st charles and marengo, 
<br><br>
i am cold & smashed & puffy AF 
<br>
when two white women 
<br>
try to convince me 
<br>
that they love my hair
<br><br>
no they really really do 
<br>
they say because it is so
<br>
black and thick and curly 
<br>
and soaking up all of the
<br>
water in the damp air. 
<br><br>
the mousy one says
<br>
through an alabama drawl:
<br>
gawd, you can do so much with it 
<br><br>
and her blonde friend says:
<br>
ya can’t do a damn thing with mine, 
<br>
won’t even hold a curl. 
<br><br>
she runs away to grab another friend 
<br>
and says to her: stacey, isn’t it even
<br>
prettier than macy gray’s? 
<br>
we just love her,
<br>
don’t we?
<br><br>
they circle me and ask:
<br>
can we touch your hair?
<br><br>
and then, suddenly,
<br>
just like my ancestors long ago,
<br>
i am pulled apart
<br><br>
soft
<br><br>
by pale hands 
<br>
from all directions.
