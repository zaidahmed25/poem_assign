There’s nothing that I really want:
<br>
The stars tonight are rich and cold
<br>
Above my house that vaguely broods
<br>
Upon a path soon lost in dark.
<br><br>
My dinner plate is chipped all round
<br>
(It tells me that I’ve changed a lot);
<br>
My glass is cracked all down one side
<br>
(It shows there is a path for me).
<br><br>
My hands—I rest my head on them.
<br>
My eyes—I rest my mind on them.
<br>
There’s nothing that I really need
<br>
Before I set out on that path.
<br><br><br>
