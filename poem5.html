<div class="poem5">
This house, pitched now
<br>
The dark wide stretch
<br>
Of plains and ocean
<br>
To these hills over
<br>
The night-filled river,
<br>
Billows with night,
<br>
Swells with the rooms
<br>
Of sleeping children, pulls
<br>
Slowly from this bed,
<br>
Slowly returns, pulls and holds,
<br>
Is held where we 
<br>
Lock all distances!
<br><br>
Ah, how the distances
<br>
Spiral from that
<br>
Secrecy:
<br>
Room,
<br>
Rooms, roof
<br>
Spun to the huge
<br>
Midnight, and into
<br>
The rings and rings of stars.
<br><br><br>
â€”Henry W. Rago
