    <div class="poem2">
    At her Junior High School graduation,
    <br>
she sings alone
<br>
in front of the lot of us—
<br><br>
her voice soprano, surprising,
<br>
almost a woman's. It is
<br>
the Our Father in French,
<br><br>
the new language
<br>
making her strange, out there,
<br>
fully fledged and
<br><br>
ready for anything. Sitting
<br>
together—her separated
<br>
mother and father—we can
<br><br>
hear the racket of traffic
<br>
shaking the main streets
<br>
of Jersey City as she sings
<br><br>
Deliver us from evil,
<br>
and I wonder can she see me
<br>
in the dark here, years
<br><br>
from belief, on the edge
<br>
of tears. It doesn't matter. She
<br>
doesn't miss a beat, keeps
<br><br>
in time, in tune, while into
<br>
our common silence I whisper,
<br>
Sing, love, sing your heart out!
<br><br><br>
