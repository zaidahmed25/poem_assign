Rain is falling through the roof.
<br>
And all that prospered under the sun,
<br>
the books that opened in the morning
<br>
and closed at night, and all day
<br>
turned their pages to the light;
<br><br>
the sketches of boats and strong forearms
<br>
and clever faces, and of fields
<br>
and barns, and of a bowl of eggs,
<br>
and lying across the piano
<br>
the silver stick of a flute; everything
<br><br>
invented and imagined,
<br>
everything whispered and sung,
<br>
all silenced by cold rain.
<br><br>
The sky is the color of gravestones.
<br>
The rain tastes like salt, and rises
<br>
in the streets like a ruinous tide.
<br>
We spoke of millions, of billions of years.
<br>
We talked and talked.
<br><br>
Then a drop of rain fell
<br>
into the sound hole of the guitar, another
<br>
onto the unmade bed. And after us,
<br>
the rain will cease or it will go on falling,
<br>
even upon itself.
